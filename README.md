# PaperlessTime
PaperlessTime is an hours logging software for small businesses used to streamline employee's clocking in and clocking out.
It is still under development but ultimatly will allow employees to clock in and clock out, as well as view a delivery schedule, access a company only chat room, 
view their past worked hours, and add deliveries to the delivery calendar. The manager or boss will be notified by email on a set interval corresponding to when 
the payroll information needs to be send out. Additionally the manager or boss will be able to view all of the rest of the employee's hours that they have worked in 
the past
